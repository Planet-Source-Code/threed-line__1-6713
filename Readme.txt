Thanks for downloading the 3d line source. I hope you find this useful. The project is ready and compiled for you to use with your VB apps if you don't like including pages and pages of code.

You can freely distribute this code but you must include this file in the zip.
If you are going to use this in your app, please include me in the credits etc...

If you want you can visit my site at: www.garrattsoftware.co.uk. I am rebuilding it at the moment to make it more VB oriented. At presesnt I built it to see if I could make some money. It didn't work.

If you have trouble fitting anything on the screen it is because it has been designed in 1280x1024.
