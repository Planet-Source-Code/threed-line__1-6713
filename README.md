## ThreeD Line


</div>

### Description

This code creates a horizontal or vertical line with a 3D look. You can see it almost in any Windows Application. This is dead simple code to understand. I saw the other 3d Line OCX in a code of the day, and it didn'y include source code. I hate including OCX's so I made my own. If you like this code, vote for me!
 
### More Info
 
Just add the usercontrol to your project and draw it on you form. Select the orientation and resize it. Its that simple.
